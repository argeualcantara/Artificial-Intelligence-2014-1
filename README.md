A multiagent application thieves vs coin savers<br/>
The main objective of this assingment was to create an agent to save coins and, eventually, deposit them on the bank.<br/>
The goal was to create an agent who wouldn't get stuck and search the whole maze for coins.<br/>
And also avoid the thief agents who wandered looking for the savers scent and pursuing until they got a hold of the coins.
